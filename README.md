# Fire-Detection Prototype (Raspberry Pi Pico)

A simple fire alarm prototype that detects temperature changes and triggers visual and audible warnings when a threshold is exceeded. 
built using a Raspberry Pi Pico, NTC thermistor, buzzer, and LED.
This project detects temperature changes and triggers visual and audible warnings when a threshold is exceeded. Temperature readings are displayed to the Serial Monitor. 

## Components:
Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi Pico

Language: C/C++ (using Pico SDK in VS Code)

NTC Thermistor (temperature sensing)

Buzzer (audible alarm)

Onboard LED (visual indicator)

10kÎ© resistor (voltage divider circuit)


## Lessons Learned:
This was my first introduction to embedded hardware and Raspberry Pi! It was definitely a humbling experience to spend hours questioning how everything worked, but it was genuinely such a fun experience to learn. Getting the LED to work for the first time made me feel so accomplished, and now I have an entire temperature monitor setup!
